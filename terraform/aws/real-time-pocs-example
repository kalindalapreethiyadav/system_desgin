Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

# terraform workspace

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-93-12 aws]$ terraform workspace list
        * default

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-93-12 aws]$ terraform workspace new dev-poc
        Created and switched to workspace "dev-poc"!

            You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
            so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
            for this configuration.

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-93-12 aws]$ terraform workspace list
        default
        * dev-poc

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-93-12 aws]$ terraform workspace select default
        Switched to workspace "default".

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-93-12 aws]$ terraform workspace list
        * default
        dev-poc
