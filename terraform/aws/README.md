âœ… How Terraform Knows Which AWS Account to Use
Terraform uses the AWS provider, and the credentials you supply determine the account. Here's how you can specify them:

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

 2. Shared Credentials File (~/.aws/credentials)
    Use the AWS CLI to configure:

        aws configure --profile dev
