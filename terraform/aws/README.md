âœ… How Terraform Knows Which AWS Account to Use
Terraform uses the AWS provider, and the credentials you supply determine the account. Here's how you can specify them:

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

 2. Shared Credentials File (~/.aws/credentials)
    Use the AWS CLI to configure:

        aws configure --profile dev


To store a Terraform plan locally in a file, you can use the -out flag with the terraform plan command. This is useful for reviewing or applying the plan later.

âœ… Command to Save the Plan to a File
    
    terraform plan -out=tfplan.out

This saves the plan to a binary file named tfplan.out.

âœ… To Apply the Saved Plan
    
    terraform apply tfplan.out

This ensures that only the changes in the saved plan are applied, which is useful for automation and approvals.

âœ… Optional: Convert Plan to Human-Readable Format

    terraform show tfplan.out


If you want to view the plan in a readable format, use:

    terraform show -no-color tfplan.out > plan.txt

Or to save it to a text file:
