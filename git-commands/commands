git fetch origin   # downloads changes from the remote repository but does not apply them to your current working branch.
git pull # git fetch + git merge --downloads and merges latest changes to local.

# git merge vs git rebase
git merge # Combines histories of two branches, creating a new merge commit.
git rebase #Rewrites the commit history by placing your changes on top of another branch.


 $git rebase -i main
 #%s/^pick/s    --- select s or pick as per requirement, resolve conflicts
 $git rebase --continue
 $git rebase --abort

 # Squash only required number of commit ids

$ git rebase -i HEAD~4

'''
You can replace pick with:
reword: Change the commit message.
edit: Pause to amend the commit.
squash: Combine this commit with the one before it.
fixup: Like squash, but discard this commit’s message.
drop: Remove the commit.'''

 $ git merge feature_branch
 git merge --abort
 git merge --continue

# Reset vs revert
$ git reset <commit-id>    # reset the commit id in local respository 
$ git revert <commit-id>  # reset the commit id in remote respository

git reset --hard HEAD~1
git revert HEAD

reset --hard: Deletes the last commit and changes — destructive.
revert: Creates a new commit that undoes the last one — safe for shared branches.

# Stash
#You're working on a feature in a Git repository, and you've made some changes to two files: index.html, style.css
#But suddenly, you're asked to switch branches to fix a bug. You don’t want to commit your current changes yet, but you also can’t switch branches with uncommitted changes.

ommand	What It Does
git stash # Saves uncommitted changes
git stash list	# Shows all saved stashes
git stash apply	# Applies stash but keeps it
git stash pop	# Applies stash and removes it
git stash drop	# Deletes a specific stash
git stash clear	# Deletes all stashes

# Recover Deleted Branch or Commit
Use git reflog to find lost commits:

$ git reflog # find all the actions of the user in git! & get the commit id of deleted branch
# Once you find the commit before the merge/deleted branch, you can recreate the branch:
$ git checkout -b feature-branch abc123
$git log --graph --oneline --all   # to view in graph and one line way
